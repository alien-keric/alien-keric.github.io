**AFRICA UNODC CTF 2022**

AFRICA UNODC CTF was organized by <a href="https://twitter.com/DFIRScience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DFIRScience</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/UNODC_WCAfrica" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNODC</a> and alot of people.This CTF was good,thanks to organizers and i really learn alot that mostly i didn't know before.
The Writeup for Week one was written by two people, me,Username <a href="https://twitter.com/blackninja233" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blackninja23</a> and my collegue, Username <a href="https://twitter.com/hashghost21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hashghost</a>

**WEEK 01 UNODC**

SCENARIO: GIVEN
```
### Week 1

A victim, Artemis Nuru, entered a local police department and claimed that "My computer was hacked. They stole all my crypto and encrypted my files. Now they're asking for more money." The victim had his laptop still running when he gave it to investigators. The forensic lab collected a RAM image using AVML and a disk image in Expert Witness Format (E01) using FTK Imager on Tsurugi Linux. **The victim claims that he does not have a phone.**

-   Week 1 Linux Disk and Memory Images: [torrent](https://archive.org/download/AfricaDFIRCTF22WK1/AfricaDFIRCTF22WK1_archive.torrent)
```

You can download the <a href="https://archive.org/download/AfricaDFIRCTF22WK1/AfricaDFIRCTF22WK1_archive.torrent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">torrent</a> for Week 1 Linux Disk and Memory Images and it highly recommend you download the datasets using the BitTorrent protocol.
After you download,you will have this file as shown below

**PREREQUISITE**
- Having Windows 10 or 8 or 7(Your Own Choice)
- That Windows with <a href="https://www.exterro.com/ftk-imager" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTK Imager </a> or  <a href="https://www.autopsy.com/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Autopsy</a> or both 
-  Having ewf-tools(in Kali,it is preinstalled)
- Having avml <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/avml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AVML</a> 
- Also even better having  <a href="https://tsurugi-linux.org/downloads.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Tsurugi Linux</a> 

## Hash Master
<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/q1.png" alt="q1" />

**FIRST WAY**

First before anything, we need to verify what i download is correctly to what was taken/ collected
Checking for disk, we will use ewfverify to check it
```consoles
ewfverify -d sha1 Disk001.E01
```
Output(last 6 lines)
```
MD5 hash stored in file:		39e369b5498fdef0814ddf15b3e610af
MD5 hash calculated over data:		39e369b5498fdef0814ddf15b3e610af
SHA1 hash stored in file:		9bbacb877e5fe4a15bf03b2ee01b18507fe9b165
SHA1 hash calculated over data:		9bbacb877e5fe4a15bf03b2ee01b18507fe9b165

ewfverify: SUCCESS
```
In which it is same as hash that file 'Disk001.E01.txt' has it
```consoles
➜  14257525-E001-SDA cat Disk001.E01.txt 
Case Information: 
Acquired using: ADI3
Case Number: 14257525
Evidence Number: E001
Unique description: E001 hard disk
Examiner: DFIRScience
Notes:  
```
The needed Output
```
[Computed Hashes]
 MD5 checksum:    39e369b5498fdef0814ddf15b3e610af
 SHA1 checksum:   9bbacb877e5fe4a15bf03b2ee01b18507fe9b165
```
ANOTHER WAY
You could just open case with either ftk imager or autopsy and read the hash from them

**ACTION TO BE DONE BEFORE WE CONTINUED**

Before we continue after verify it, we need to mount our disk so as to play with it as we answer question followed.
Move Your disk image to Tsurugi Linux
First we need to check in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_mapper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">device mapper </a> if there is  logic volumes exist in /dev/mapper
```
tsurugi@lab:~/DISK01$ ls -la /dev/mapper
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root      60 Jun  1 03:41 .
drwxr-xr-x 18 root root   13760 Jun  1 16:14 ..
crw-------  1 root root 10, 236 Jun  1 03:42 control
tsurugi@lab:~/DISK01$ 
```
in our system there is no logic volumes exist

Second step, we need to check what kind of file is this so as to know how to mount it
```
tsurugi@lab:~/DISK01$ file Disk001.E01
Disk001.E01: EWF/Expert Witness/EnCase image file format
tsurugi@lab:~/DISK01$ 

```
The format is expert witness format
Short commands
```
sudo ewfmount Disk001.E01 /mnt/ewf1 #whereDISK001.E01islocated#
sudo kpartx -a /mnt/ewf1/ewf1
sudo lvscan
sudo mount /dev/vgmint/root /mnt/c #(resultfromlvscan that /dev/vgmint/root)#
chroot /mnt/c
```

Third step, we need to mount it and our best tool is  <a href="https://andreafortuna.org/2018/04/11/how-to-mount-an-ewf-image-file-e01-on-linux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ewfmount</a> 
```
tsurugi@lab:~/DISK01$ sudo ewfmount Disk001.E01 /mnt/ewf1
[sudo] password for tsurugi: 
ewfmount 20210807


```
We can verify by checking if file 'ewf1' was created
```
tsurugi@lab:~/DISK01$ sudo ls -la /mnt/ewf1
total 4
dr-xr-xr-x  2 root root           0 Jun  1 16:37 .
drwxr-xr-x 44 root root        4096 Nov 14  2021 ..
-r--r--r--  1 root root 21474836480 Jun  1 16:37 ewf1

```
Also check by type command 'mount'(no need of root)
```consoles
mount
```
Output(check last line)
```
/dev/fuse on /mnt/ewf1 type fuse (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0)
```
Fourth step, we need to access partitions inside a physical device by using a tool called  <a href="http://www.microhowto.info/howto/mount_a_partition_located_inside_a_file_or_logical_volume.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kpartx</a> 
```consoles
sudo kpartx -a /mnt/Disk001_W01/ewf1
```
```
tsurugi@lab:~/DISK01$ sudo kpartx -a /mnt/ewf1/ewf1
[sudo] password for tsurugi: 
tsurugi@lab:~/DISK01$ ls -la /dev/mapper
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root     160 Jun  1 16:41 .
drwxr-xr-x 19 root root   13880 Jun  1 16:41 ..
crw-------  1 root root 10, 236 Jun  1 03:42 control
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root       7 Jun  1 16:41 loop6p1 -> ../dm-0
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root       7 Jun  1 16:41 loop6p2 -> ../dm-1
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root       7 Jun  1 16:41 loop6p5 -> ../dm-2
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root       7 Jun  1 16:41 vgmint-root -> ../dm-3
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root       7 Jun  1 16:41 vgmint-swap_1 -> ../dm-4
tsurugi@lab:~/DISK01$ sudo lvs
lvs     lvscan  
tsurugi@lab:~/DISK01$ sudo lvscan
  ACTIVE            '/dev/vgmint/root' [<18.51 GiB] inherit
  ACTIVE            '/dev/vgmint/swap_1' [976.00 MiB] inherit
tsurugi@lab:~/DISK01$ 

```
After that,we then mount /dev/vgmint/root to /mnt/c so as to play with it
```
tsurugi@lab:~/DISK01$ sudo mount /dev/vgmint/root /mnt/c
mount: /mnt/c: WARNING: device write-protected, mounted read-only.
tsurugi@lab:~/DISK01$ 

```
Then we move to /mnt/c 
```
tsurugi@lab:~/DISK01$ cd /mnt/c
tsurugi@lab:/mnt/c$ ls
bin   cdrom  etc   lib    lib64   lost+found  mnt  proc  run   snap  sys  usr
boot  dev    home  lib32  libx32  media       opt  root  sbin  srv   tmp  var
tsurugi@lab:/mnt/c$ 

```
Let move to our mount as if we are in it
```
root@lab:/home/tsurugi/DISK01# chroot /mnt/c
root@lab:/# 
root@lab:/# 

```

## Code breaker
<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/q2.png" alt="q2" />

We have text **JrypbzrgbNsevpnPGS** that seems need to decode.We can use site like  <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dcode.fr</a>  to recognize the text and it show that it is rot13. You can use the <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/rot-13-cipher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">same site</a> to decode it  
```
└─$ python3

Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import codecs
>>> codecs.encode('JrypbzrgbNsevpnPGS', 'rot_13')
'WelcometoAfricaCTF'
>>> 

```
Our flag is ```WelcometoAfricaCTF```

## What do we have here?
<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/q3.png" alt="q3" />

We also have a memory image as we given after download it.But it has been compressed via snappy. Let first observe the header with command 'xxd'
```
└─$ xxd E001.lime.snappy |head
00000000: 4156 4d4c 0200 0000 0010 0000 0000 0000  AVML............
00000010: ffef 0900 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  ................
00000020: ff06 0000 734e 6150 7059 0027 1200 4d80  ....sNaPpY.'..M.
00000030: b255 8080 0400 00fe 0100 fe01 00fe 0100  .U..............
00000040: fe01 00fe 0100 fe01 00fe 0100 fe01 00fe  ................
00000050: 0100 fe01 00fe 0100 fe01 00fe 0100 fe01  ................
00000060: 00fe 0100 fe01 00fe 0100 fe01 00fe 0100  ................

```
We see the first 4 bytes 'AVML' then we search it online, we come to  <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/avml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avml github</a> but we can use <a href="https://tsurugi-linux.org/downloads.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Tsurugi Linux</a>  for this issue in which avml and avml-convert as our tool is already installed. Use avml-convert to convert it to lime
```
tsurugi@lab:~/MEM01$ ls
E001.lime.snappy
tsurugi@lab:~/MEM01$ avml-convert ./E001.lime.snappy ./E001.lime

```
Observe lime with xxd command
```
tsurugi@lab:~/MEM01$ xxd E001.lime |head
00000000: 454d 694c 0100 0000 0010 0000 0000 0000  EMiL............

```
we have our first 4 bytes and it is our flag, it is  ```EMiL```

## Part of the way
<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/q4.png" alt="q4" />

Basically, it is to know which partition start at that offset.
We can use a tool called fdisk or mmls
```
root@lab:/home/tsurugi/MEM01# fdisk -l
```
Output(middle lines)
```
Disk /dev/loop6: 20 GiB, 21474836480 bytes, 41943040 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x1bf47736

Device       Boot   Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type
/dev/loop6p1 *       2048  1050623  1048576  512M  b W95 FAT32
/dev/loop6p2      1052670 41940991 40888322 19.5G  5 Extended
/dev/loop6p5      1052672 41940991 40888320 19.5G 8e Linux LVM

```
We can see ```/dev/loop6p5``` the offset has start at 1052672 in which it is Linux LVM
Using mmls
```
root@lab:/home/tsurugi/DISK01# mmls Disk001.E01
DOS Partition Table
Offset Sector: 0
Units are in 512-byte sectors

      Slot      Start        End          Length       Description
000:  Meta      0000000000   0000000000   0000000001   Primary Table (#0)
001:  -------   0000000000   0000002047   0000002048   Unallocated
002:  000:000   0000002048   0001050623   0001048576   Win95 FAT32 (0x0b)
003:  -------   0001050624   0001052671   0000002048   Unallocated
004:  Meta      0001052670   0041940991   0040888322   DOS Extended (0x05)
005:  Meta      0001052670   0001052670   0000000001   Extended Table (#1)
006:  001:000   0001052672   0041940991   0040888320   Linux Logical Volume Manager (0x8e)
007:  -------   0041940992   0041943039   0000002048   Unallocated

```
Also from this, we can as well ,it start from 0001052672 in which it is ```Linux Logical Volume Manager``` then our flag is ```Linux Logical Volume Manager```

## Everyone Likes Cartoons

After i see this, i decided to go and check Download but also we see the username of this user is bighero in which it is also name of animation. but remember to follow up there if you want to interact with it
```
root@lab:/# ls /home/
bighero
root@lab:/# su bighero
bighero@lab:/$ cd ~/Downloads/
bighero@lab:~/Downloads$ ls
Big-Hero-7.jpg                          i2pinstall_1.8.0.jar        tor-browser-linux64-11.0.13_en-US.tar.xz
google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb  icecat-17.0.1-64bit.tar.gz
bighero@lab:~/Downloads$ 

```
We can see some few files we were downloaded. let deal with that pic
<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/Big-Hero-7.jpg" alt="Big-Hero-7" />

With name, you can think it is big hero 7 but after google it, we can confirm it is not yet out and we have big hero 6
Let dig deep
**Logic**

Let us have our logic straigth

User did download icecat, google chrome, tor browser and other browser that we dont see here it is mozilla firefox meaning that we should check it

```
bighero@lab:~$ cd .mozilla/

bighero@lab:~/.mozilla/firefox/jfnvehc5.default-release$ 

```

Let check what was entered in forms when he was browsing and we can check our file called formhistory.sqlite
```
sqlitebrowser /mnt/c/home/bighero/.mozilla/firefox/jfnvehc5.default-release/formhistory.sqlite
```
As you can see when you open this file and browse the “moz_formhistory” table, there are loads of entries which give you a bit of insight into how this feature works.
<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/bighero6.png" alt="bighero6" />

We can see user search for big hero 6
Also User use name of bighero6 as hostname
```
bighero@lab:~$ cat /etc/hostname
bighero6
bighero@lab:~$ 
bighero@lab:~$ 

```
Then our flag is ```bighero6```

## History 👀
<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/q6.png" alt="q6" />

After awhile, we discover it was firefox browser, by view under storage then default

Check the methodology down

We have our browser which it is firefox but you can view data.sqlite, if you prefer to know more what was done in the pluto.tv
Our flag is ```firefox```

## ฿
<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/q7.PNG" alt="q7" />

We can look at also that formhistory from earlier as it contain things we have searched in forms 

<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/bighero6.png" alt="bighero6" />

and see most of time,they mention bitpay, with little google, 
```
BitPay is a bitcoin payment service provider headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. It was founded in May 2011 by Tony Gallippi and Stephen Pair. BitPay provides Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash payment processing services for merchants.
```
we undestand it is our flag ```bitpay```

## So Dark
<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/q8.png" alt="q8" />

We review back to our Downloads from user bighero
```
bighero@lab:~/Downloads$ ls
Big-Hero-7.jpg                          i2pinstall_1.8.0.jar        tor-browser-linux64-11.0.13_en-US.tar.xz
google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb  icecat-17.0.1-64bit.tar.gz
```
see browsers that were downloaded and after review, we found something in icecat  and also i2p and tor are darkwebs in our machine but first let review how did victim access darkweb
```
sqlitebrowser /mnt/c/home/bighero/.mozilla/icecat/wk4ls5vn.default/formhistory.sqlite
```
<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/icecat_formhistory.png" alt="icecat_formhistory" />

we can see user access nurucoin.i2p and others i2p in which mostly many were observed in <a href="https://www.autopsy.com/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Autopsy</a> .We can understand i2p by understand eepsite
```
An eepsite is a website that is hosted anonymously, a hidden service which is accessible through your web browser. It can be accessed by setting your web browser’s HTTP proxy to use the I2P web proxy (typically it listens on localhost port 4444), and browsing to the site.
```

Well, Our flag is ```i2p```

## HISTORY 👀👀
<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/q9.png" alt="q9" />

This is browser history and every browser have default location to store history, in this case user used chrome browser to access the web that let him install bitcoin wallet. This file can be found on path `~/.config/google-chrome/Default/History`. This file can be accessed by using both **AccessData FTK Imager** or by using **tsurugi**.
This file is in sqlite format then we have to export it and read it with **SQlite database browser** through the following steps.

**Navigate up History file and export it.**

<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/history.PNG" alt="history" />

**Open the file with SQlite databse browser**
```console
┌──(gemstone㉿hashghost)-[~/C7F5/unodc]
└─$ ls
diskImage  History  memoryImage  setups

┌──(gemstone㉿hashghost)-[~/C7F5/unodc]
└─$ sqlitebrowser History
```

**Select table urls**
When is SQlite database browser is open navigate to **Browse Data** and change table from to **urls** and copy **https://snapcraft.io/bitpay** \'last_visit_time.

<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/snap.png" alt="snap" />

This time is in the chrome format and not human readable.

**Convert the time**
On  [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20458406/what-is-the-format-of-chromes-timestamps)there is a query which can be executed by SQlite database browser. then we will use the following query to convert.
```sql
SELECT
  datetime(13029358986442901 / 1000000 + (strftime('%s', '1601-01-01')), 'unixepoch', 'localtime')
```
**Result**


<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/time.png" alt="time" />

## I'm rich! ...nevermind. 
<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/am rich.png" alt="am rich" />

Once again this question involves the browsing history but the only difference is that it was performed o top of anonymous network **i2p**. The file can be accessed on the following path `~/.i2p/eepsite/docroot/` and 3 files can be found.
```console
bighero@lab:~/.i2p/eepsite/docroot$ ls
favicon.ico  index.html  robots.txt
bighero@lab:~/.i2p/eepsite/docroot$ cat index.html 
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="1;url=/help/" />
<meta http-equiv="pragma" content="no-cache">
<meta http-equiv="cache-control" content="no-cache">
<title>Bitcoin</title>
</head>
<body>
Send me bitcoin. I want to buy a lambo.
bc1qkzqng3jtg87syx3apftj7q0tp686hm48mtwu2c
</body>
</html>
bighero@lab:~/.i2p/eepsite/docroot$ 
```
Then on opening index.html then we can find find the following ink `bc1qkzqng3jtg87syx3apftj7q0tp686hm48mtwu2c` which is the answer of the question.
## Little weird
<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/littleweird.png" alt="littleweird" />

It seems that user installed some different tools on his machine and one of them was **ncat** tool. This is log and can be found on `/var/log/apt/` and then read the **history.log** file.
```console
bighero@lab:/var/log/apt$ cat history.log | grep ncat -C 6
Commandline: /usr/bin/apt install i2p

End-Date: 2022-05-28  23:51:42
```
Then through this log it is clear that user installed ncat at `2022-05-28  23:51:39`
## EEP!
<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/eep.png" alt="eep" />

To access or use eepsite user must do some configurations on i2p network so that he/she can access the internet and one of the main things he must specify **hostname**.  Something important to note is that all i2p host-name ends with ## **.i2p** extensions. 
We managed to do this question by using **Autopsy** tool through the following steps.

**Select HTML files**
On autopsy, navigate to File Types-->Documents-->HTML

<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/html.png" alt="html" />

**Open files with susidns.html**
On listing view of autopsy, click the second file with susidns.html name 

<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/sudns.png" alt="sudns" />

**Result**
Below the listing view you will see the a picture appearing as picture, scroll down to Hostname

<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/nurucoin.png" alt="nurucoin" />

Then user's eepsite hostname is `nurucoin.i2p`

##  You shall pass!

<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/pass.png" alt="pass" />

This is one among of the tough easy question hahahaha, just kidding. we heard some people crack the password in some days and still got nothing but we solve this question in unexpected way.
On scenario, user handled his machine to the police station while it was still on then according to this the password files and some of data were captured by memory and did not appear in disk image.
We can use memory dump to its fully potential by dump strings from memory and crack our password that user had from /etc/shadow

```
password is ``$Hero!!`` and it is our answer

## Trying to be sneaky, eh?
<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/sneeky.png" alt="sneeky" />

As we all know that in linux file-system, sometimes additional application tends to be configured in opt directory, then user configured eepsites in opt directory together with its binary.
This can performed by **AccessData FTK Imager** or **tsurugi**

**Navigate to /opt/icecat directory**

<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/opt.png" alt="opt" />

and opening it

<img src="/assets/img/AfricaDFIRCTF2022/Week01/icecat.png" alt="icecat" />

This is the binary that is running the eepsite so the correct answer here is `/opt/icecat/icecat`
